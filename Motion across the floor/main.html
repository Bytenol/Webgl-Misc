<!--
    This program is designed to simulate the motion resulting from the forces 
    acting on a body with a specific mass as it moves across the floor.

    The simulation takes into account three main forces: weight, normal force, and friction. 
    In this case, since the floor is not inclined, the normal force always balances the weight along the Y-axis. 
    
    This equilibrium ensures that the resultant force in the Y-direction is zero, 
    preventing the body from sinking into the ground.

    Furthermore, due to the absence of any applied force along the X-axis, 
    the static kinetic friction remains zero when the velocity of the body is also zero
