<!--
    This program is designed to simulate the motion resulting from the forces 
    acting on a body with a specific mass as it moves across an inclined plane.

    The simulation takes into account three main forces: weight, normal force, and friction. 
    In this case, since the plane is inclined, acceleration will occur only if the resulting 
    x-component of gravity is greater than the static friction of the plane. 

    You can move the slider to see different reaction at different anglw
